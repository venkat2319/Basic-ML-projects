      "it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . \n",
      "although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . \n",
      "ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . \n",
      "these \" small \" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . \n",
      "left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . \n",
      "refusing to stay over at her parent's house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . \n",
      "despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . \n",
      "sure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ? \n",
      "in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . \n",
      "unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . \n",
      "every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . \n",
      "for all of its strong aspects , \" leila \" isn't a perfect film . \n",
      "on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . \n",
      "and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . \n",
      "mehrjui's decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . \n",
      "despite these minor missteps , \" leila \" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york's cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . \n",
      "the thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila's self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . \n",
      "it's difficult to not consider how leila's culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through . \n",

      "contrary to the misleading trailers , \" gattaca \" is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there's lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes . \n",
      "this is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories . \n",
      "in fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who's novel \" brave new world \" featured genetically engineered children ) . \n",
      "it's a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what \" gattaca \" presents . . . and the main reason i dug it so much . \n",
      "the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years . \n",
      "as a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired . \n",

      "the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . \n",
      "based on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , \" a civil action \" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children's death from leukemia due to unknown causes . \n",
      "jan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city's drinking water . \n",
      "suddenly , after hearing about the families' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . \n",
      "also figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . \n",
      "coming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , \" a civil action \" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . \n",

      "worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . \n",

      "it doesn't necessarily move as though they're memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . \n",
      "but despite its tediousness , perhaps that's the point . \n",
      "the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . \n",

      " titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't . \n",
      "the film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film . \n",
      "we all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic . \n",
      "but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron's best films ) \n",
      "the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic . \n",
      "they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman . \n",
      "the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her . \n",
      "the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic . \n",
      "in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america . \n",
      "also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich . \n",
      "she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them . \n",
      "oh yeah , and the ship sinks . \n",
      "and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius . \n",
      "the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak . \n",
      "the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film . \n",
      "without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear . \n",
      "firstly , there's cameron's direction . \n",
      "there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic . \n",
      "but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end . \n",
      "there is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron . \n",
      "it's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below . \n",
      "thanks to cameron's direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes . \n",
      "to support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters . \n",
      "dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old . \n",
      "his performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines . \n",
      "winslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth . \n",
      "zane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash . \n",
      "the audience really does come to hate him . \n",
      "he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well . \n",
      "also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american . \n",
      "finally , the icing on the 'great things' cake are the special effects . \n",
      "cameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout . \n",
      "the sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well . \n",
      "the humans seem to move to 'smoothly' , there's just something odd about them . \n",
      "you can tell that they have been animated on a computer . \n",
      "of course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed . \n",
      "titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film . \n",
      "titanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story . \n",
      "again , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts . \n",
      "titanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius . \n",
      "enjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound . \n",

      "in a perfect world , \" a civil action \" would be a breath of fresh air . \n",
      "it's cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn't . \n",
      "it's romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn't . \n",
      "and , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending . \n",
      "even if it's based on a true story , a true story which hasn't yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless . \n",
      "hell , \" a civil action \" is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes \" the firm , \" the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic ) . \n",
      "yet it's also oddly and slightly unsatisfying . \n",
      "weird . \n",
      "this is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired \" search for bobby fischer \" ( didn't see it ) and writer of none other than \" schindler's list . \" \n",
      "in short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories . \n",
      "after all , apart from the obvious it's-a-holocaust-film and it's-a-spielberg-film , isn't \" schindler's list \" just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study . \n",
      " \" a civil action \" is the same way : it's narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study . \n",
      "and it's here that the film seems to go a bit wrong . \n",
      "the main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it's an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that's not necessarily the problem with the film . \n",
      "it's that it's just kind of unsatisfying . \n",
      "if this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way . \n",
      "but this film just seems to end , and i don't want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won't bitch about what is , essentially , genuine . \n",
      "but the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it . \n",
      "it's rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who's shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he's manipulative and he always wins . \n",
      "it wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full . \n",
      "we see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don't fully believe it . \n",
      "and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film's conclusion that of incompleteness . \n",
      "in the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases . \n",
      "in short , he's full of bullshit and we know it . \n",
      "in the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river . \n",
      "point one , it's not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren't nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success ) . \n",
      "point two , it has been through several lawyers . \n",
      "after turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town's company . \n",
      "they spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in \" wilde , \" pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant . \n",
      "they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on ) . \n",
      "as we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis ) . \n",
      "things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money . \n",
      "as macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , \" fargo \" ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist . \n",
      "in fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic . . . i \n",
      "suppose like a grisham novel ) . \n",
      "this wouldn't be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he's seen as being still full of bullshit . \n",
      "because he doesn't take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out . \n",
      "the final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian's mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he's seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he's not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film's final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow ) . \n",
      "the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it's still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has . \n",
      "we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life . \n",
      "it only feels like half of that . \n",
      "maybe even less . \n",
      "and it's not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite . \n",
      "up to then , though , it's an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period . \n",
      "the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it's about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother . \n",
      "we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town , but the reason it can't be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find . \n",
      "and duvall's facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it's almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is . \n",
      "facher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him . \n",
      "but look deeper and you see a master at work : his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him , and it's difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way . \n",
      "that's why i liked this film : it's hard to put a pointer on . \n",
      "you can never see exactly where this film will land , and even when the credits roll , you still aren't sure what to make of it . \n",
      "call it the zallian effect . \n",
      "same thing happened with \" schindler's list \" ( not that i'm comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman ) . \n",
      "each film is so greatly crafted that you can't help but get involved in its broad storytelling , interesting characters , and , most peculiarly , the wit that comes along with it . \n",
      "if only it felt totally complete ( like , say , \" schindler's list , \" though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two ) , it might have been one of the best films of the year , and along with that , a full breath of fresh air . \n",

      "initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix . \n",
      "while it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm . \n",
      "the buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . 's \" losing my religion \" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory . \n",
      "despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery . \n",
      "all of the sequences where we delve into someone's mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe . \n",
      "the first sequence that takes place in stargher's mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i've ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher's victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room . \n",
      "if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) . \n",
      "the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) . \n",
      "in my opinion , d'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . - \n",
      "the newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him . \n",
      "the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him . \n",
      "detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both . \n",
      "besides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher's penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling . \n",
      "a sequence where catherine enters stargher's mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting . \n",

      "on the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy . \n",
      "the sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man . \n",
      "but it wasn't not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick . \n",
      "i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron's entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) . \n",
      "of course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn't his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude . \n",
      "he actually plays a \" macho \" guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he's hypnotized . \n",

      "anyway , she's really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn't miss a beat of allen's fast-paced dialogue . \n",

      "he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita . \n",
      "he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her . \n",
      "the story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace . \n",
      "the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him . \n",
      "the opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn't done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? \n",
      "this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn't possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general . \n",
      "in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits . \n",
      "the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and \n",

      "the censors wouldn't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through . \n",

      "it doesn't have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had . \n",

      "he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience . \n",
      "and when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he's her prisoner for as long as he lives . \n",
      "and dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible . \n",
      "she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character . \n",
      "it's easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time . \n",
      "when he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her . \n",
      "there are two other minor characters in the film , one who's a road block in the beginning , and the other who's a reappearing threat to the relationship . \n",
      "the former is charlotte , lolita's mother , played by melanie griffith . \n",
      "in the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish . \n",
      "and she's the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning . \n",
      "as played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she's about half of them . \n",
      "it's annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first . \n",
      "and even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she's nothing more . \n",
      "the other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price . \n",
      "langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original . \n",
      "quilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk . \n",
      "langella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him . \n",
      "as you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise . \n",

      "more importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it . \n",

      " with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the \" film noir \" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller's crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . \n",
      "their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . \n",
      "the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world , but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . \n",
      "that main character is jeffrey \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as \" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . \" \n",

      "these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of \" hotel california \" and , if it's possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . \n",
      "if that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug . \n",
      "they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . \n",
      "the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . \n",

      "soon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german \" nihilists \" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . \n",
      "meanwhile , the big lebowski's daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . \n",

      "the film doesn't feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude's dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . \n",
      "the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this \" jungle \" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . \n",
      "there's also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his \" this aggression will not stand \" speech . \n",
      "the coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( \" the bums will always lose ! \" \n",
      "shouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their \" peaceful beach community , \" and so on . \n",
      "by the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least \" aggression \" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on \" passive , \" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . \n",
      "he also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn't like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he's getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . \n",
      "the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don't just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . \n",

      "in my opinion : \n",
      "in short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is . \n",
      "review : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions . \n",
      "the town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant . \n",
      "there is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate . \n",
      "put simply , it's a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for . \n",
      "j one big note however is that it is only a 50's sitcom that airs in reruns on an \" oldies \" tv station ? or is it ? \n",
      "i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed . \n",
      "i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office . \n",
      "but it wasn't until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy \" dollar theaters \" after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced . \n",
      "it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some \" healthy \" immorality is not a world at all . \n",
      "instead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn't give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right . \n",
      "there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story . \n",
      "now i'm not saying that's necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be . \n",
      "besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch . \n",
      "the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable . \n",
      "after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it's hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more . \n",
      "a truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork . \n",
      "that said , the plot goes as such . \n",
      "david and jennifer are two very 90's high school twins with the typical \" relationship \" outline of don't-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won't-mess-with-yours . \n",
      "they demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today . \n",
      "david is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation . \n",
      "but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home . \n",
      "nevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed . \n",
      "and , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them . \n",
      "not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place . \n",
      "people got hurt . \n",
      "they cried . \n",
      "they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that's when their physical world turned colors as well . \n",
      "this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear . \n",
      "i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we'll never know what we could have done better . \n",

      "trash tabloid reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a best-seller based on their ordeal , the basis of which has been turned into a ( very bad ) movie called \" stab . \" \n",

      "thus , the possible victim/potential killer list includes said quartet , as well as : derek ( jerry o'connell ) , sidney's new beau ; cici ( sara michelle gellar ) , a chatty sorority gal ; joel ( duane martin ) , gale's cameraman who's not too thrilled with her blood-soaked past ; hallie ( elise neal ) , sidney's sassy roommate ; debbie ( laurie metcalf ) , a local reporter who gives gale some not-too-friendly competition ; and mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , randy's good friend and fellow film student . \n",

      "she is a pleasure to see on screen . \n",
      "when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters . \n",

      "toy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct-to-video project , disney's standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film . \n",

      "fortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them . \n",

      "forget the self-congratulatory science fiction of the matrix -- this is a fundamental mind-bender for buzz , and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight . \n",
      "here , as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children's tv show that originated his character , we see our protagonists come face-to-face with god . \n",
      "in sly ways , then , toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality , a metaphorical consideration of aging and death . \n",
      "significantly , the film's very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our opening-night crowd in a near-uproar . \n",
      "and toward the end , when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys , one of them observes , with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking , that it will be fun while it lasts . \n",
      "so toy story 2 joins the tradition of children's stories , largely neglected of late , that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence . \n",
      "what's really striking is that both toy story films ( and , to a lesser degree , pixar's a bug's life ) are kids' movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts , not to mention whatever piece of tot-friendly eye-candy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer . \n",

      "this highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . \n",
      "and with good reason . \n",
      "this is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . \n",

      "uma thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . \n",
      "unfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . \n",
      "at this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . \n",

      "or at least , that's the intention . \n",
      "the film's framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek's deep space 9 ) , is trying to \" correct \" him . \n",
      "when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on \" mein kampf , \" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek's life and how it has gotten him nowhere . \n",
      "coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he's cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . \n",
      "he's just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he's wisened up . \n",
      "he's no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who's becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . \n",
      "but danny won't . \n",
      "he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . \n",
      "the film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . \n",
      "we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . \n",
      "to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . \n",
      "and frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . \n",
      " \" american history x \" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . \n",
      "in it , there are some of the best scenes i've seen all year . \n",
      "one scene features a dinner between derek's family , and his mother's newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek's rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould's reaction to derek's final summation is unnerrving ) . \n",
      "another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . \n",
      "and another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . \n",
      "there's much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he's given in what seems like a really long time ) . \n",
      "norton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . \n",
      "in only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . \n",
      "there's nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . \n",
      "that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . \n",
      "sadly enough , this isn't going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . \n",
      "it's too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . \n",
      "the ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . \n",
      "some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the \" fat skinhead , \" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn't as well travelled . \n",
      "furlong's danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn't seem like it has actually arrived there . \n",
      "even derek's descent into skinhead-dom doesn't seem justified . \n",
      "though his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from \" boy meets world , \" and don't ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . \n",
      "as such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . \n",
      "sorta . \n",
      " \" american history x \" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . \n",
      "somewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . \n",
      "although he aimed for the directing credit to go to \" alan smithee , \" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn't allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that's the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . \n",
      "kaye's right in that it's not up to par , even if he's not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . \n",
      "this will not be a \" do the right thing \" for the late 90s . \n",
      "yet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one's own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . \n",
      "and even if it isn't perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he's done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience . \n",

      " some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s . \n",
      "since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . \n",
      "bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account . \n",
      "it's rare that a movie with the moniker \" based on the life of ? \" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . \n",
      "raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . \n",
      "the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . \n",
      "for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . \n",
      "historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion's share of the details culled from la motta's own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage ) . \n",
      "however , although la motta is credited as the movie's \" consultant , \" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout . \n",
      "the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . \n",
      "sex and violence are inextricably linked . \n",
      "the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . \n",
      "in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . \n",
      "outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . \n",
      "the two people who spar with him on life's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . \n",
      "these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . \n",
      "he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . \n",
      "raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . \n",
      "over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . \n",
      "meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . \n",
      "vicki becomes jake's greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . \n",
      "his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . \n",
      "hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . \n",
      " ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : \" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? \" ) \n",
      "in the late '40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . \n",
      "he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . \n",
      "two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . \n",
      "by the late '50s and early '60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . \n",
      "raging bull is the other side of rocky . \n",
      "sylvester stallone's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . \n",
      "it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . \n",
      "but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . \n",
      "while scorsese's primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . \n",
      "rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . \n",
      "there's little i can say here that hasn't already said about de niro's performance . \n",
      "in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . \n",
      "the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . \n",
      "and , although there's a lot of travis bickle ( de niro's character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . \n",
      "this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . \n",
      "as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . \n",
      "as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . \n",

      "scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few \" home movie \" segments are in color ) . \n",

      "in black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese's choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . \n",
      "there's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . \n",
      "during fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta's perspective . \n",
      "scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta's loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . \n",
      "after that , his career was all downhill . \n",
      "yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta's future . \n",

      "following his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . \n",

      "part of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n",
      " \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \n",

      "the plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \n",
      "thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \n",
      "part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \n",

      "another thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing . \n",
      "there are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \n",
      "the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \n",

      "the \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \n",
      "when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \n",
      "consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \n",
      "out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \n",
      "why ? \n",
      "because once you got past the thought that \" they're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \n",
      "they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \n",
      "conversely , \" chicken run \" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \n",
      "if you've never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \n",
      "even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \n",
      "park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \n",
      "enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \n",
      "the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \n",
      "ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \n",
      "she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \n",
      "the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet . \n",
      "poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help . \n",
      "jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \n",
      "they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \n",
      "one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \n",
      "the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \n",
      "the animation is first-rate . \n",
      "remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \n",
      "this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \n",
      "as in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug's life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \n",
      "certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details . \n",

      "if he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . \n",
      "or how about pocahontas' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? \n",
      "i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . \n",

      " star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) \n",
      "review by matt pusateri \n",
      "few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars . \n",
      "the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \n",
      "arguably , more americans today can explain what \" the force \" or a \" jedi \" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \n",
      "so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \n",
      "can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \n",
      "against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \n",
      "and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \n",
      "while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \n",
      "it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \n",
      "the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \n",
      "as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \n",
      "the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \n",
      "the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \n",
      "later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \n",
      "on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \n",
      "qui-gon senses the child is \" unusually strong \" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be \" the one \" prophesized to \" bring balance to the force . \" \n",
      "as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \n",
      "complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \n",
      "while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \n",
      "if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \n",
      "the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \n",
      "but the complexity is not overwhelming . \n",
      "the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \n",
      "one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \n",
      "it's unclear whose story phantom menace is . \n",
      "in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \n",
      "but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's . \n",
      "if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation . \n",
      "lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \n",
      "on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is \" the one . \" \n",
      "the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \n",
      "neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \n",
      "mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \n",
      "portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \n",
      "the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \n",
      "individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \n",
      "but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \n",
      "in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \n",
      "the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \n",
      "in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \n",
      "there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \n",
      "individually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \n",
      "this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \n",
      "but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \n",
      "many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \n",
      "first , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \n",
      "the characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing \" destroyers \" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \n",
      "each location is elaborate and complex . \n",
      "lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \n",
      "most of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made . \n",
      "more than ever , in this new film , lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \n",
      "the best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \n",
      "watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \n",
      "of all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \n",
      "speaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \n",
      "with more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \n",
      "jar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon's accidental sidekick . \n",
      "jar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \n",
      "the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \n",
      "however , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn't completely convincing . \n",
      "he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \n",
      "throughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a \" roger rabbit \" -like presence . \n",
      "you accept that he's there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \n",
      "initially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \n",
      "on my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all . \n",
      "a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \n",
      "despite all the film's struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one's destiny and \" the force , \" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \n",
      "fortunately , lucas hasn't lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \n",
      "from the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film's thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \n",
      "in the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \n",
      "and finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \n",
      "from beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \n",
      "the pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \n",
      "the phantom menace won't win any major oscars . \n",
      "it probably won't beat titanic's box office record . \n",
      "and it's not even the best star wars film ( i'd put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \n",
      "but it's an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \n",
      "the film can't live up to it's hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \n",
      "but it's still worth seeing . . . \n",

      "the mouse factory's latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters . \n",
      "mulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming , \n",
      "mulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say . \n",
      "the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . \n",
      "the emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation . \n",

      "yet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy . \n",

      "his fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but it's a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters . \n",
      "the movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan's are winners . \n",
      "the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot . \n",
      "the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus . \n",
      "mulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame . \n",

      "mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain . \n",
      "also , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production . \n",

      " in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . \n",
      "sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . \n",
      "his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . \n",

      "whichever one you like , dear , he says . \n",

      "i liked that scene for two reasons . \n",
      "first , the cakes looked really cool . \n",
      "second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . \n",
      "meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . \n",
      "it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . \n",
      "the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . \n",
      "i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . \n",
      "case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . \n",
      "however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . \n",
      " ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) \n",
      "it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . \n",
      "and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . \n",
      "well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . \n",
      "so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . \n",
      "anyway , the deceased lawyer's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . \n",
      "the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . \n",
      "if this weren't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our society . \n",
      "it also doesn't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . \n",

      "he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . \n",
      "he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . \n",
      "and as played by brad pitt , he's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he's just there . \n",
      "it's as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . \" \n",
      "it's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . \n",

      "so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \n",
      "my , how easily does the worm turn . \n",
      "hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \n",
      "at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \n",

      "from what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend . \n",

      "i'm not entirely sure why , exactly . \n",
      "in many ways , \" drunken master \" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii , \" master with cracked fingers \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , \" spiritual kung fu \" , and others . \n",
      "in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . \n",
      "to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . \n",
      "they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america . \n",
      "these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \n",
      " \" drunken master \" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . \n",

      " \" drunken master \" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii and \" master with cracked fingers \" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been \" adapted , \" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . \n",
      "more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka \" naughty panther , \" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . \n",
      "after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and \n",
      "is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . \n",
      "his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . \n",
      "kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . \n",
      "while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . \n",
      "this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . \n",
      "he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . \n",
      "then , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . \n",
      "unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . \n",
      " \" drunken master \" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . \n",
      "it's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . \n",
      "in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . \n",
      "the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . \n",
      "whether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see . . . and \n",
      "it's often as funny as anything , too . \n",
      "and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . \n",
      "there's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \n",
      "schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \n",
      "but they're still hilarious as ever . \n",
      "likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \n",
      "the really big thing about \" drunken master \" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \n",
      "i'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \n",
      "it apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it . \n",
      "genuine or not , i have to admit , there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on . \n",
      "come to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films . . . it's \n",
      "not just martial arts , it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , \" whoa . . . \" \n",
      "on the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \n",
      " \" gone with the wind \" , this isn't . \n",
      "still , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \n",
      "it's much more \" real \" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \n",
      "you might very well like it . \n",
      "another interesting thing about \" drunken master \" has to do with its video availability in the us . \n",
      " \" drunken master \" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \n",
      "there are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \n",
      "thankfully , \" drunken master \" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \n",
      "if you like \" drunken master \" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren't really _too_ bad . . . if \n",
      "nothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \n",
      "i particularly recommend \" spiritual kung fu \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , the \" fearless hyena \" movies , and \" snake & crane arts of shaolin \" . \n",
      "also , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , \" drunken master ii \" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \n",

      "it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . \n",
      "the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . \n",
      "the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files . \n",
      "the aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . \n",
      "they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . \n",
      "the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey . \n",
      "most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . \n",
      "scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . \n",
      "the debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway's atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind's representative to another species . \n",
      "the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . \n",
      "still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . \n",
      "the two \" sides \" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . \n",
      "palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . \n",
      "then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . \n",
      "contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . \n",
      "the film's one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . \n",
      "for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . \n",
      "the romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss's explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( \" i guess you could say i'm a man of the cloth , but without the cloth \" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . \n",
      "instead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . \n",
      "granted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers' part more than anything else . \n",
      "the successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . \n",
      "even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn't ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . \n",
      "contact doesn't quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . \n",

      "even though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting . \n",
      "as i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he's on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he's not acting , that he's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . \n",
      "the character himself isn't very interesting -- he's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . \n",

      "nonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . \n",
      "unfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . \n",
      "turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct's artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots . \n",

      "perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . \n",
      "the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are \" takers , \" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . \n",
      "i can sympathize with that , but only when it's in a compelling film . \n",

      " whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms . \n",
      "he made the west dirty in \" mccabe and mrs . miller \" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in \" the long goodbye \" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with \" popeye \" ( 1980 ) . \n",
      "the same holds true for his most recent film , \" the gingerbread man , \" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie . \n",
      "by the time \" the gingerbread man \" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham . \n",
      "there's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn't feature a great showdown in a courtroom . \n",
      "instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , \" the gingerbread man \" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman's trademark full-frontal female nudity . \n",
      "the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham's other lawyer heroes . \n",
      "he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds . \n",
      "rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) . \n",
      "a reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn't hard to surmise that rick's womanizing had a large part in it . \n",
      "whenever he's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it's because he's been \" screwing around . \" \n",
      "after an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn't lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses . \n",
      "he drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together . \n",
      "rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers . \n",
      "it was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does \" weird \" stuff like that . \n",
      "as another character puts it , dixon is \" a few beers short of six-pack . \" \n",
      "rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency . \n",
      "he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory's begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) . \n",
      "dixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out . \n",
      "from there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action . \n",
      "altman's cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look . \n",
      "if it isn't night-time , at least it's raining . \n",
      "gu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light . \n",
      "a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability . \n",
      "in the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world . \n",
      "altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies . \n",
      "but , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings . \n",
      " \" the gingerbread man \" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here . \n",
      "however , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller . \n",
      "a great deal of the credit for the film's success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction . \n",
      "here , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic . \n",
      "rick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . \n",
      "without it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick's pain and frustration . \n",
      "the supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in \" schindler's list \" ( 1993 ) . \n",
      "tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird . \n",
      "it doesn't seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film's one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing . \n",
      "while \" the gingerbread man \" isn't in league with altman's greatest works like \" nashville \" ( 1975 ) or \" the player \" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career . \n",
      "some critics love to stamp films like this as \" commercial , \" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don't make money . \n",
      "altman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more . \n",

      "be forewarned . \n",
      "like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent . \n",
      "a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking . \n",
      "the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop . \n",
      "as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity . \n",
      "recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar . \n",
      "wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his \" one special thing \" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a \" big bright shining star \" . \n",
      "his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in . \n",
      "the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious . \n",
      "from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question . \n",
      "while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent . \n",
      "it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film . \n",
      "while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour . \n",
      "the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded . \n",
      "while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous . \n",
      "a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking . \n",
      "ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights . \n",
      "it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters . \n",
      "after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs . \n",
      "larry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public . \n",
      "however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business . \n",
      "the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided . \n",
      "if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves . \n",
      "jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) . \n",
      "in both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of \" there are shadows in light , baby \" to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's \" it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture ! \" \n",
      "rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false . \n",
      "in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark . \n",
      "much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes \" this is the best work i've ever done \" , it's genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness . \n",
      "mr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter . \n",
      "while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane \" how much can you bench ? \" \n",
      "banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges . \n",
      "and while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions . \n",
      "still , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same . \n",
      "in any case , it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it's a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger's \" sister christian \" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard . \n",
      "if this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness . \n",
      "there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights . \n",
      "mr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect . \n",
      "similarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver's seat , sobbing \" i'm so stupid \" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver's seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening . \n",
      "boogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good . \n",
      "while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention . \n",
      "mr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard's georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film . \n",
      "i'm not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee . \n",
      "mr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it's wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation . \n",
      "worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track \" you got the touch \" in a vain attempt at a musical career . \n",
      "mr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective . \n",
      "ms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry . \n",
      "consequently , it's a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she's lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp . \n",
      "her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she's essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity . \n",
      " ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) \n",
      "and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham's parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant's drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet . \n",
      "draw your own conclusions . \n",
      "perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion . \n",
      "his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it's no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry . \n",
      "while the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle's eyes makes the scene unforgettable . \n",
      "luis guzman's most famous work is possibly in brian de palma's carlito's way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who's a hanger-on to jack's group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures . \n",
      "jack's eventual acquiescence to maurice's request leads to one of boogie nights' biggest comic payoffs . \n",
      "boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work . \n",

      "they are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it doesn't help matters any when \" mystery man \" ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving . \n",

      "i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch doesn't offer any neat wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of \" lost highway \" are out in full force from beginning to end . \n",
      "this description might make \" lost highway \" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch's weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time . \n",
      "on the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch's previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther . \n",
      "the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery . \n",
      "there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here . \n",
      "we , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred's , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent . \n",
      "all of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch's typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style . \n",
      "as is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in \" lost highway \" it works perfectly . \n",
      "there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred's blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil's \" song to the siren \" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically \" happening \" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity . \n",

      "well , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer's attention because of its tie-ins to the original mystery . \n",
      "the main characters in this \" reality \" - dayton ( a well-meaning but none too intelligent 24-year-old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn-star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn't find in any of the two dozen \" pulp fiction \" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film's spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch . \n",
      "lynch's typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here . \n",

      "it's something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship . \n",

      "it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . \n",
      "artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically \" disneyfied \" ethnic tale . \n",
      "there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . \n",
      "the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . \n",

      "the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . \n",
      "it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . \n",
      "the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . \n",
      "both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . \n",
      "however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . \n",
      "the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . \n",
      "the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . \n",
      "for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . \n",
      "my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one . \n",
      "my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . \n",
      "in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too . \n",
      "the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . \n",

      "this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . \n",
      "even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding . \n",
      "with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . \n",

      "his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . \n",
      "dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . \n",

      "some tried to write off \" mandingo \" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it's not that easy . \n",
      " \" mandingo \" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as \" the bible \" ( 1966 ) , the remake of \" king kong \" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated \" dune \" ( 1984 ) . \n",
      "the director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" ( 1954 ) and \" fantastic voyage \" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as \" the narrow margin \" ( 1952 ) . \n",

      "james mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . \n",
      "so why is \" mandingo \" so bad ? \n",
      "a number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . \n",
      "wexler's script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( \" yessuh , massuh \" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( \" fer whut're you gittin' outta bed ? \" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( \" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! \" ) . \n",
      "fleischer's direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . \n",
      "nevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . \n",
      "despite its exploitative nature , \" mandingo \" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . \n",
      "until then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . \n",
      "even classics such as \" gone with the wind \" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . \n",
      " \" mandingo \" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn't all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . \n",
      "but all this is constantly undermined by the film's negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . \n",
      "with a little more maturity and different handling , \" mandingo \" might have been an effective , worthwhile film . \n",
      "while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . \n",
      "the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler's script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . \n",
      "there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but \" mandingo \" never does it . \n",
      "steven spielberg touched on that same topic in \" schindler's list \" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . \n",
      "the difference between that film and \" mandingo \" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . \n",
      " \" mandingo \" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its \" trashy potboiler \" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . \n",

      "even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \n",
      "on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \n",
      "this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \n",
      "the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \n",
      "instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \n",
      "although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime . \n",
      "amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much . \n",
      "every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \n",
      "distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . \n",
      "in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \n",
      "after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \n",
      "fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \n",
      "even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \n",
      "characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \n",
      "every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions . \n",
      "because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \n",
      "even the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \n",
      "when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \n",
      "unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics . \n",
      "lack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters . \n",
      "each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \n",
      "fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \n",
      "because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \n",
      "fellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \n",
      "vignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies . \n",
      "fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \n",
      "even the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \n",

      "[light spoilers , nothing you shouldn't read] \n",
      "existenz has been called \" a gooey matrix \" , and while this is a correct description in some ways , in others it is completely off . \n",
      "the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal , \" real \" reality . \n",
      "a major difference is that \" the matrix \" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality , while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true . \n",
      "and oh what a reality it is . \n",
      "david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies ( naked lunch , crash ) , but this one is one of the strangest . \n",
      "maybe it's because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre . \n",
      "technology is organic , but only some of it . \n",
      "cars are normal . \n",
      "gas stations are the same . \n",
      "cell phones are glowing bug like appendages . \n",
      "you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus ( referred to simply as a \" pod \" ) . \n",
      "high technology has been replaced with organic creatures , and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters . \n",
      "a famous game designer , allegra geller ( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh ) , flees a demonstration of her latest game , existenz , after an assassination attempt . \n",
      "she is on the run ( from who , i'm still not sure ) , and has to save her pod by playing her game with \" someone friendly \" . \n",
      "that someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard , ted pikul ( jude law ) . \n",
      "unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing , a bioport . \n",
      "sort of a hole in your spine ( ok , exactly like a hole in your spine ) , a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail-looking wires from the pod into you , allowing you to play the game . \n",
      "luckily a bioport can be installed easily ( they install them in malls ) , so off they go to get one . \n",
      "after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station , they are able to plug in and play existenz . \n",
      "the plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies , reality distortion , chinese restaurants , and multi appendaged amphibian things ( \" it's a sign of the times \" ) . \n",
      "but the plot , while cohesive in it's own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe . \n",
      "cronenberg just slaps this weird organic-tech world into the viewers lap , and it's up to you to figure out how all these things work . \n",
      "and that's the true joy of this film , entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place . \n",
      "you learn a little bit piece by piece ( oh , they make pods out of those ) , and it's just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you . \n",
      "there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around , including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards . \n",
      "also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz , the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover . \n",
      "there's lots of little things that set off the weird-o-meter , like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store , the two headed amphibian creature , and why that guy at the gas station's name appears to be \" gas \" . \n",
      "it all adds up to a supremely far out trip , and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix's virtual world . . . \n",

      "from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right . \n",
      "with bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance . \n",
      "the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best . \n",
      "the movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date . \n",
      "here is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years . \n",
      "jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up . \n",
      "he really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch ) . \n",
      "so he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad . \n",
      "he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any . \n",
      "then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars . . . . as \n",
      "long as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm . \n",
      "now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths . \n",
      "ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs . \n",
      "even the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good . \n",
      "the plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old . \n",
      "the choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any . \n",
      "even though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him . \n",
      "rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout . \n",
      "her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen . \n",
      "brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old . \n",
      "one really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before . \n",
      "it's not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness . \n",
      "'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all . \n",
      "ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career . \n",
      "chris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal . \n",
      "he seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old . \n",
      "artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving . \n",
      "why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know . \n",
      "maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts . \n",
      "its based on the 1925 silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess . \n",
      "even though some may think of this as a good date movie , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back . \n",
      "besides being a terrible movie , 'the bachelor' is well a terrible movie . \n",
      "it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie . \n",
      "i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times . \n",
      "the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes . \n",
      "parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time . \n",

      "a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands . \n",
      "it wasn't just the film's disappointing box office performance . \n",
      "indeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times . \n",
      "no , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year . \n",
      "in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : \" mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! \" . \n",
      "executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late . \n",
      "mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history . \n",
      "unfortunately , faye dunaway's energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film's only redeeming feature . \n",
      "based on daughter christina crawford's trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother . \n",
      "if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania . \n",
      "the film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother's will . \n",
      "joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see . \n",
      "but that's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film's end . \n",
      "the script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum . \n",
      "frank perry's direction is no more than competent , and dunaway's bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving . \n",
      "in fairness , the film's second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters . \n",
      "when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina's own acting and career ambitions . \n",
      "crawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain . \n",
      "you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers . \n",
      "ah , but there is dunaway's performance . \n",
      "and what a delicious piece of campery it often is . \n",
      "having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden . \n",
      "she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she's making . \n",

      "dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . \n",
      "the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . \n",
      "dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . \n",
      "it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . \n",
      "quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . \n",
      " * * * the review * * * \n",
      "released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . \n",
      "director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . \n",
      "the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . \n",
      "dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . \n",
      "the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . \n",
      "the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . \n",
      "it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . \n",
      "most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to \" fold space \" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . \n",
      "lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands . \n",
      "one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . \n",
      "the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . \n",
      "the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . \n",
      "unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . \n",
      "the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . \n",
      "with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . \n",
      "what a great idea ! \n",
      "why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? \n",
      "the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . \n",
      "thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . \n",
      "the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them . \n",
      "and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . \n",
      "dune is also a very serous film . \n",
      "the constant \" self-talk \" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . \n",
      "the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . \n",
      "humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . \n",
      "you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy . \n",
      "the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . \n",
      "it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . \n",
      "special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight . \n",
      "both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . \n",
      "and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . \n",
      "with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . \n",
      "see it in the widescreen format if you can . \n",
      "and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . \n",
      "sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim is to manipulate paul's destiny for its own shadowy ends . \n",
      "as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . \n",
      "the conclusion ? \n",
      "any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert's original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . \n",
      "david lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . \n",
      "dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . \n",
      "many chose to stay away altogether , as the film's disastrous box office showing attests . \n",
      "the extended version , however , is a rather different beast . \n",
      "in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition \" director's cut \" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . \n",
      "but , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \n",
      "in a way , then , it is partly lynch's own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \n",
      "stung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director's guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with \" allen smithee \" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \n",
      "he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous \" judas booth \" . \n",
      "certainly , looking at the results of mca's handiwork there's at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \n",
      "but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \n",
      "most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version's storyline . \n",
      "paul's relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \n",
      "the political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \n",
      "paul's initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \n",
      "and as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \n",
      "as a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv's version of dune is clearly superior . \n",
      "as a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \n",
      "the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \n",
      "there's some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \n",
      "and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \n",
      "ships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \n",
      "this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \n",
      "it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \n",
      "but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn't even in herbert's book . \n",
      "the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his \" heart plug \" . \n",
      "its a surreal and disturbing episode that's very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \n",
      "despite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \n",
      "all up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \n",
      "unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the \" alan smithee \" version remains the closest we'll get to what the movie should have been . \n",
      "on repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \n",
      "still , as one of this century's great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \n",
      "with rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \n",

      "be forewarned . \n",
      "on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . \n",
      "although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . \n",
      "the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . \n",
      "the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . \n",
      "scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . \n",
      "and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . \n",
      "it's hard to understate this last point . \n",
      "mr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . \n",
      "indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional \" a film by wes craven \" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads \" written by kevin williamson \" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . \n",
      " ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of \" a film by \" is attained . ) \n",
      "and , much like mr . tarantino's screenwriting , mr . williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . \n",
      "in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . \n",
      "scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . \n",
      "while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging . \n",
      "like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the \" true life \" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . \n",
      "however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen ) . \n",
      "there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . \n",
      "flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . \n",
      "the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . \n",
      "they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . \n",
      "the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? \n",
      "there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) . \n",
      "any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . \n",
      "as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . \n",
      "one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . \n",
      "here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . \n",
      "the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . \n",
      " ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) \n",
      "indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . \n",
      "this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . \n",
      "while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . \n",
      "they're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . \n",
      "it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . \n",
      "in terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . \n",
      "their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . \n",
      "on the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . \n",
      "she doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine . \n",
      "given this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . \n",
      "what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . \n",
      "the film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . \n",
      " ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious . ) \n",

      "earth' idea revamped ! \n",
      "if you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not have escaped the hype over id4 . \n",
      "it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary . \n",
      "id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 . \n",
      "the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50's hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era . \n",
      "the movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked . \n",
      "the aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth . \n",
      "the us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens' intention but soon finds out when david ( goldblum ) a scientist , discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities . \n",
      "capt . hiller ( smith ) , a hot-shot f-18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc . \n",
      "his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders , he crash lands after a spectacular 1-on-1 chase over the grand canyon , one of the many highlights of the movie . \n",
      "id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses . \n",
      "acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) . \n",
      "no prizes for guessing how id4 ends , its just plain obvious . \n",
      "id4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x-files on screen . \n",
      "if i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens . \n",
      "however below that wafer-thin plot and on-screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion . \n",
      "an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen-viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no matter how ridiculous . \n",
      "id4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company . \n",
      "some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f-18's and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi . \n",
      "id4 is a movie for all . \n",
      "though there are many explosions and implied deaths , there are no gory scenes of human destruction , thus young kids should be able to take it . \n",
      "sit back and don't be too critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was . \n",

      "he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . \n",

      "while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) , believe in a more organic approach . \n",
      "they operate on the notion ( quoting straight from the press kit ) \" that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained . \n",
      "aki and dr . sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force . \n",
      "the waves will , in effect , cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion . \n",
      "they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave . \n",

      "already , the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams . \n",
      "aiding aki and dr . sid are the deep eyes , a group of hard-as-nails types that would have felt at home with the troops in \" aliens . \" \n",
      "capt . gray edwards ( alec baldwin ) heads the task force that consists of a wise guy ( buscemi ) , a tough woman ( peri gilpin ) and a gentle giant ( ving rhames ) . \n",
      "throwing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass : in this case general hein ( james woods ) , who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age , even if it destroys earth as well . \n",

      "i understand why so many live-action films employ them ? they're cheap ? but animated films can show anything , so why wallow in an industrial trash heap ? \n",

      "be forewarned . \n",
      "east meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney's parade of annual animated feature films . \n",
      "an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential . \n",
      "though not for lack of trying . \n",
      "in many respects , mulan is among disney's most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat . \n",
      "the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child's discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? \n",
      "in an instant , idealistic mulan's innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending . \n",
      "the film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family's obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) . \n",
      "dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney's new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film's vocal work , there's liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . \n",
      "while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can't imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it's rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . \n",
      "the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan's land . \n",
      "at its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage . \n",
      "as such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity . \n",
      "scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan's venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . \n",
      "mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine's character-defining opening half-hour . \n",
      "it's when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . \n",
      "off to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little \" lucky \" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief . \n",
      "they're affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity . \n",
      "at training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang . \n",
      "everybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film . \n",
      "the romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story's neo-feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . \n",
      "another staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . \n",
      "composed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- \" i'll make a man out of you \" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . \n",
      "only \" reflections \" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre's most wondrously pure voices . \n",
      "nonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . \n",
      "while the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they're not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . \n",
      "briskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter . \n",

      " the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . \n",
      "it's 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his \" attorney \" dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . \n",
      "these two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . \n",
      "duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won . \n",
      "he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . \n",
      "fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . \n",
      "it doesn't , even in the beginning--while the pair's antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark . \n",
      "director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we're laughing , we're laughing at them rather than with them . \n",
      "they spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . \n",
      "the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it's probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand . \n",
      "all this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture . \n",
      "thankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , \" riding the wave \" of something that seemed special and important . \n",
      "now it's six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . \n",
      "materialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the \" american dream \" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . \n",
      "the social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . \n",
      "in many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam's most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements . \n",
      "yet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . \n",
      "the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke's world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . \n",
      "unlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . \n",
      "during the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn't seem to approve , doesn't do anything to stop it either . \n",
      "by the time this scene takes place , they don't seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . \n",
      "duke seems to realize at some level that he's become something he doesn't like , but he's either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . \n",
      "this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . \n",
      "while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that . \n",
      "there's plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the '60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren't usually very pleasant . \n",
      "unlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who's given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . \n",
      "in its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it's sad and regretful , but i think it's also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism . \n",
      "indeed , duke himself admits at one point that he's never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . \n",

      "  \" dangerous beauty \" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 . \n",
      "it is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness . \n",
      "dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff . \n",
      "the director , marshall herskovitz , doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation . \n",
      "the film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe . \n",
      "at this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce . \n",
      "the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived . \n",
      "however , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment . \n",
      "the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy ) . \n",
      "unfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in . \n",
      "veronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider . \n",
      "after a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her . \n",
      "however , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco's world , albeit not as his wife . \n",
      "she decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite . \n",
      "a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied . \n",
      "at one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants . \n",
      "veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself . \n",
      "once she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well . \n",
      "she is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco . \n",
      "their relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances . \n",
      "in many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love . \n",
      " \" love the love , not the man , \" as her mother told her . \n",
      " \" dangerous beauty , \" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice . \n",
      "it has multiple plot lines -- including veronica's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france's military assistance in venice's battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing . \n",
      "much of the film's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role . \n",
      "known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson's ire in \" braveheart \" ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady . \n",
      "she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes . \n",
      "the rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in \" dark city \" have assured him a solid place in hollywood . \n",
      "he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas . \n",
      "oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy . \n",
      "platt is a good actor , but he's just too hard to hate . \n",
      "jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco's uncle . \n",
      " \" dangerous beauty \" is marshall herskovitz's sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film \" jack the bear . \" \n",
      "partnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( \" thirtysomething , \" \" my so-called life \" ) and in the movies ( \" legends of the fall \" ) . \n",
      "his directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions . \n",
      "he could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids . \n",
      " \" dangerous beauty \" contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative . \n",
      "herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller \" kalifornia \" ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara's dark sci-fi film \" body snatchers \" ( 1994 ) . \n",
      "bazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery . \n",
      "however , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( \" brazil , \" \" the princess bride \" ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( \" the age of innocence \" ) . \n",
      "the only problem with \" dangerous beauty \" is that it doesn't stick with you . \n",
      "it's a good story well-told with interesting characters , but it's easy to shrug off once you've left the theater . \n",
      "the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it's simply too melodramatic and conventional . \n",
      "herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no real weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter . \n",

      "the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . \n",

      "the bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . \n",

      "on the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne's shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . \n",
      "also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . \n",

      "the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson . \n",
      "the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) . \n",
      "in his time , english king edward i \" longshanks \" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by \" ius primae noctis \" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights . \n",
      "although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) . \n",
      "murron's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country . \n",
      "through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace's rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge . \n",
      "but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader . \n",
      "braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann . \n",
      "however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre . \n",
      "the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism . \n",
      "while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish . \n",
      "this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood . \n",
      "compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays . \n",
      "braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics . \n",
      "what makes braveheart \" larger than life \" is his protagonist . \n",
      "mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero . \n",
      "wallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side . \n",
      "naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) . \n",
      "however , even those who don't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child . \n",
      "because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren't as effective as they should be . \n",
      "mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors . \n",
      "most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema . \n",
      "brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman's general ) is also very good as wallace's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol . \n",
      "david o'harra is very entertaining as wallace's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce . \n",
      "women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess . \n",
      "catherine mccormack as wallace's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on . \n",
      "from the technical point of view , the film is also very good . \n",
      "photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen . \n",
      "on the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times . \n",
      "although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism . \n",
      "the main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of \" longshank \" 's son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) . \n",
      "he is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain's camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in \" politically correct \" hollywood . \n",
      "to make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals . \n",
      "however , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century . \n",
      "according to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges . \n",
      "this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . \n",
      "in the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre . \n",

      "both melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? the old man' ) are perfect in their roles . \n",
      "it's hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured . \n",

      "to be fair , i must admit that i've never been very fond of \" period-piece \" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . \n",
      "perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it's because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . \n",
      "in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . \n",
      "or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . \n",
      "having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i've seen , and i quite enjoyed it . \n",

      "well , so was i . \n",
      "drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . \n",
      "where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong's practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . \n",
      "apparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i've heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i'll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . \n",
      "one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the \" once upon a time in china \" movies , but i have not yet seen those . \n",
      "the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you're watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren't expecting something on the order of \" war and peace \" . \n",
      "the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china's cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . \n",
      "however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong's perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . \n",
      "the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . \n",
      "in the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . \n",
      "in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . \n",
      "after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general's son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \n",
      "and so it goes . \n",
      "and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong's girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i've already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \n",
      "let's move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \n",
      "action . \n",
      "there's plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \n",
      "course , in a kung fu film , that's to be expected . \n",
      "however , this isn't just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \n",
      "the primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \n",
      "further , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \n",
      "there's a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \n",
      "under normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \n",
      "the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i'll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \n",
      "another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \n",
      "even without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \n",
      "among other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \n",
      " ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \n",
      "unlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \n",
      "drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . \n",
      "the performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \n",
      "the scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong's father's back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong's mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband's anger away from fei-hong ) . \n",
      "jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he's in fine form all through drunken master ii . \n",
      "as far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \n",
      "it's nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \n",
      "the picture is crisp and clear . \n",
      "one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i've ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \n",
      " ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \n",
      "it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \n",

      "since invisibility , once achieved , isn't much of an effect ( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness ) , the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon's character gets invisible he can head straight for them . \n",

      " renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller . \n",
      "tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances . \n",
      "writer steven e . desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little . \n",
      "van damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans . \n",
      "it's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . . \n",
      " . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ . \n",
      "while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting \" skills \" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort , 1996's _the_quest_ ) . \n",
      "a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : \" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! \" \n",
      "and \" entrepreneurship , babycakes ! \" \n",
      "standing out among my favorites . \n",
      "but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs . \n",
      "van damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual . \n",
      "early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way . \n",
      "even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug . \n",
      "paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode . \n",
      "in rochon's defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage . \n",
      "tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work . \n",
      "here , though , tsui's visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise . \n",
      "for each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous . \n",
      "this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context . \n",
      "for instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box . \n",
      "as he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen . \n",
      "it's undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something . \n",
      "the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired . \n",
      "tsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza . \n",
      "there isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui's legendary hong kong works ( but that's a given going in ) . \n",
      "if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo's stateside success , he would do best to break free from van damme . . . \n",
      "before it's too late . \n",
      "if he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ , the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish . . . \n",
